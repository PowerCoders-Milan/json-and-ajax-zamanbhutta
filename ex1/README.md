# Ex 1 - JSON

var object = {
  id: 1,
  title: "this is a note",
  content: "This is the amazing content of the note!"
}

Take the object, add one key-value pair to it and transform it in a JSON.

Now take the JSON, transform it back into an object with a new name, call and console log each one of the values.
