# week6 ajax json

We learnt how to use Ajax to dinamically change parts of a website.

Let's practice the most important parts:
- HTTP requests like GET are how we get the data
- fetch is the method that we use to make the requests
- JSON (similar to objects) is the format in which we get the data and send the data 
- Promises are the JS built-in objects with which we handle asyncronous responses coming from the HTTP request

This is really important for our projects!

Let's make sure that we learn it, on thursday we will see many different APIs to use :)
